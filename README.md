## Uniqueness - Client Information Gathering JavaScript Module

**Description:**
Uniqueness is a JavaScript module designed to gather information about website visitors on the client-side. This module can provide valuable data about the visitor's device, browser, and more. It's particularly useful for logging visitor information or implementing browser fingerprinting.

### Features:

1. **Client-Side Data Gathering:** Uniqueness collects information directly from the visitor's web browser without requiring a server or API.

2. **Logging:** You can use the gathered information for logging purposes, which can be helpful for tracking user activity or debugging.

3. **Browser Fingerprinting:** Uniqueness can assist in generating unique browser fingerprints for identifying and distinguishing visitors.

4. **Webhooks:** If you don't have a server to log data, Uniqueness provides integration with Discord and Guilded webhooks. This means you can keep visitor logs even on static websites.

5. **CORS Proxy:** To utilize Guilded API, Uniqueness employs a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) proxy, making it possible to use Guilded's features without the need for a dedicated server.

6. **Additional Features:** This module offers various features that you can incorporate into your scripts for enhanced functionality.
